WARNING: [Labtools 27-1973] Mismatch between the design programmed into the device xc7z020 (JTAG device index = 1) and the probes file(s) F:/zdyz_ZYNQ_FPGA/vivado_code/vivado_prj/fft_zishiying_lvboqi/fftjian/fftjian.runs/impl_1/fft_dds_signal_recovery.ltx.
 The device core at location uuid_6A4E2C41D09B584288BA7E06E7271BB6, has 13 ILA Input port(s), but the core in the probes file(s) have 5 ILA Input port(s).
Resolution: 
1. Reprogram device with the correct programming file and associated probes file(s) OR
2. Goto device properties and associate the correct probes file(s) with the programming file already programmed in the device.
